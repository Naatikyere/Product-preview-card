## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


```css
 .img_info p{
      white-space: initial;
      line-height: 25px;   
    }

```


### Continued development

Looks like the use of Basic HTML and CSS understanding is better now. And i would like to focus more on Javascript.

Would be working on Javascript related assignments in the near future. Would Love to have More mentors to help and guide me in my choosen field.

And would work using frame works like react also.
